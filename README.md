## Demos description

### Crypto Tracker Demo Application

Telerik Crypto Tracker demo is a cross-platform .NET MAUI application targeting Android, iOS, macOS, and WinUI. It is designed to demonstrates a real-life crypto application that shows changes in cryptocurrency prices, built with the [Telerik UI for .NET MAUI controls](https://www.telerik.com/maui-ui).

For more information on the application and a walkthrough of how it was built, please refer to the [CryptoTracker Documentation page](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/maui/demos-and-sample-apps/crypto-app) and [CryptoTracker Blog Post](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/maui/demos-and-sample-apps/crypto-app)
